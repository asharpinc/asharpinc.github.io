# Welcome to the A Plus Blog!

We're a team of three working on becoming an industry-leading engineering team.
As part of this endeavour, we have a few tangible goals in mind. We use the
"Objectives and Key Results" (OKR) technique pioneered by Intel, Google, and
others. One of our objectives for the next six months (approximately) is
"be an industry-leading engineering team".

### What makes an industry-leading engineering team?

Trying to be an effective engineer is the same as trying to be effective at
anything; you need to look at the most effective people in the world and find
the things they have in common and what sets them out from others. This can't
be an exact science, and simply doing what everyone else does won't
guarantee that we will lead our industry or even be more effective, but it's
an important step to recognize areas of improvement and become inspired by
those who have done what we want to do.

### You can't do it alone

When we had our OKR meetings and we defined the objective "be an
industry-leading engineering team", we discussed what we perceived as the
attributes common to the most effective engineering teams around the world.
At the risk of falling prey to selection bias, we realized that the most
effective programmers aren't solitary loners trying to eke out meager
performance improvements. The best engineers and teams are on Twitter,
Reddit, GitHub, and Facebook, promoting the work they do and giving back to
the community. So we recognized two key areas of improvement:

- Open source involvement
- Blogging

In short, we want to increase our digital footprint. We want others to know
about us, and we want to contribute to the ever-growing ecosystem of software.
Therefore, we've endeavoured to start and use
[our blog](engineering.aplus.com), and eventually we would like to contribute
at least one piece of open source software.

Thanks for the attention, and keep on being awesome! Keep on the lookout for
increased social presence from the A Plus Engineering team!
