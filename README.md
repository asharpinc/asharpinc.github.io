# A Plus Dev Blog

Our dev blog is based on
[Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

## Adding posts

Add a new post by adding a new file to the `_posts` directory. The filename
should be of the form `YYYY-MM-DD-Example-Title.md`. This is a markdown file.

The file needs front matter to describe it. Example:

    ---
    layout: post
    title: Example Title
    post_author: Your Name
    ---
    # Header

    ## Subhead

    Hey, here's some text

You don't need to reload anything. Just push to the master branch of this repo
and everything will automatically update. Yay!
